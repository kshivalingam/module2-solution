                &nbsp Although &nbsp the terms "data" and "information" are often used interchangeably, these terms have distinct meanings. In some popular publications,
                data are sometimes said to be transformed into information when they are viewed in context or in post-analysis.[3] In academic treatments of the subject,
                however, data are simply units of information. Data are employed in scientific research, businesses management (e.g., sales data, revenue, profits, stock price), finance, governance (e.g., crime rates, unemployment rates, 
                literacy rates), and in virtually every other form of human organizational activity 
                (e.g., censuses of the number of homeless people by non-profit organizations).
